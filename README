*DESCRIPTION*

gphoto2-timelapse allows you to create timelapse photography using the Raspberry Pi (http://www.raspberrypi.org/), supported DSLR camera connected via USB (http://gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/support.php), and the gphoto2 unix tool (http://www.gphoto.org/).

*Installation*

You will need to install python to run the intervalometer (timelapse) scripts. - http://www.python.org/getit/

You can use the install scripts - gphoto2-install / install

It's a great idea to install gphoto2 from source as the pre-built libraries are generally old. The gphoto2-install script does just this.

*USE*

Once everything is installed, you need to tweak the script a bit to get it to work with different cameras. Once you have the camera specific parameters and functions in place, you can use the python scripts to being taking images.

python timelapse.py
python sun.py
