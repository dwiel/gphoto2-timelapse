See here for a much improved version: https://github.com/jflalonde/gphoto2-timelapse

*DESCRIPTION*

gphoto2-timelapse allows you to create timelapse photography using the Raspberry Pi (http://www.raspberrypi.org/), supported DSLR camera connected via USB (http://gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/support.php), and the gphoto2 unix tool (http://www.gphoto.org/).

*Installation*

1) install python (http://www.python.org/getit/), on the raspberry pi you should already have python installed.  If you don't, run:
    sudo apt-get install python
2) ./gphoto2-install if you don't already have gphoto2 installed
3) ./install

gphoto2-install will build and install gphoto2 from source.  This was helpful for me since the libraries in the public apt-get repositories are old and don't support as many cameras.

*USE*

Once everything is installed, you need to tweak the script a bit to get it to work with different cameras. Once you have the camera specific parameters and functions in place, you can use the python scripts to begin taking images.

python timelapse.py
python sun.py

There is also an rc script which you can use to start the timelapse script automatically whenever the computer (raspberry pi) is turned on.  To setup this feature run the following commands:

sudo ln ./rc.timelapse /etc/init.d/rc.timelapse
cd /etc/init.d/
sudo update-rc.d rc.timelapse defaults
